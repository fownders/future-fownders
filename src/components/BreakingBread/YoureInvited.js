                        <p className="grey-text f-25 lh-160">Breaking Bread is a monthly exclusive charity dinner series where culinary artistry, convo and cause collide. This month’s theme is ‘Concepts Unbound’. In a world that moves at a thousand miles per hour and is ever changing, so many of us are suffering from the inability to adapt while maintaining control of our inner equilibrium. ‘Concepts Unbound’ dares to ask, are you bound by your unchanging concepts? It’s time to reconceptualize the way you see yourself and the world around you.</p>
