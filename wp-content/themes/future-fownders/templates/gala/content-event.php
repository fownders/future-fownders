                    Future Fownders is a nonprofit entrepreneurial education program with concentrations for elementary through high school aged students, powered by Fownders. We are approaching our first full year of active in-school programming and we invite you to join us as we come together to highlight the impact and forward facing vision of Future Fownders!<br><br>
                    Future Fownders Gala 2017 is a celebratory campaign to garner support from individuals and corporations who realize the widespread need for outdated standard curriculums to engage our youth with real-world education for the future. Future Fownders integrates school-based learning with real-world concepts to help students identify the relationship between culture, education and the workplace through the principles of entrepreneurship. Our future fownders complete the program with expanded horizons, a greater awareness of their strengths and improved preparedness to be our socially conscious, goal driven, community oriented leaders of tomorrow.<br><br>
                    We cannot do this alone. Sponsorships and donations made to the nonprofit are crucial in providing Future Fownders with the funding needed to further our mission of educating our youth for the future. With your help, Future Fownders is able to level-up by increasing the number of schools reached and students impacted, expand programming and most importantly, continue to cultivate and inspire our next generation of leaders. Are you in?
